          The creation of the modern bank was announced in 1968 and commenced trading on 1 January 1970 after the
          statutory process of integration had been completed in 1969.[12] The three arrowheads device was adopted as
          the new bank's logo; it is said to symbolise either the circulation of money in the financial system or the
          bank's three constituents.[13] The District, National Provincial and Westminster banks were fully integrated
          in the new firm's structure, but private bankers Coutts & Co (a 1920 National Provincial acquisition,
          established 1692), Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland (a 1917 Westminster acquisition, established 1836) and the
          Isle of Man Bank (a 1961 National Provincial acquisition, established 1865) continued as separate operations.
          Westminster Foreign Bank (established 1913) was restyled International Westminster Bank in 1973. Duncan
          Stirling, outgoing chairman of Westminster Bank, became first chairman of the fifth largest bank in the
          world.[14] In 1969 David Robarts, former chairman of National Provincial, assumed Stirling's position.[15] In
          1975 it was one of the first London banks to open a representative office in Scotland. It was a founder member
          of the Joint Credit Card Company (with Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank and Williams & Glyn's Bank) which launched
          the Access credit card (now part of Mastercard) in 1972 and in 1976 it introduced the Servicetill cash
          machine. The same banks, excluding Lloyds, were later responsible for the introduction of the Switch debit
          card (later branded Maestro) in 1988.[16]

          NatWest Group operates internationally through its four principal subsidiaries: NatWest Holdings which owns
          The Royal Bank of Scotland, National Westminster Bank and Ulster Bank Ireland DAC; NatWest Markets; NatWest
          Markets N.V.; and The Royal Bank of Scotland International. The NatWest sub-group of companies comprises
          National Westminster Bank and its subsidiary and associated undertakings.[54] As of 2020, the principal
          subsidiary undertakings of NatWest are:

          Coutts & Co.
          Nordisk Renting
          Lombard North Central[55]
          Structurally, National Westminster Bank was a wholly owned subsidiary of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group
          until 2003, when ownership of the bank's entire issued ordinary share capital was transferred to The Royal
          Bank of Scotland as holding company, with RBS Group functioning as ultimate holding company. At the same time
          the entire issued share capital of Lombard North Central was transferred by the bank to the holding
          company,[56] transferring back to NatWest in 2017. Ownership of National Westminster Home Loans was passed to
          the holding company in 2005;[57] however, the mortgage portfolio and related funding were also transferred
          back to NatWest in 2012.[58] In 2000, the bank transferred National Westminster Life Assurance to RBS Life
          Investments, effectively establishing the business as a joint venture between the Group and Norwich Union.[59]
          In 2018, ownership of both NatWest and the Royal Bank transferred to NatWest Holdings and NatWest became the
          main provider of shared services and Treasury activities for the RBS Group.[60] On 14 February 2020, it was
          announced that RBS Group would be renamed NatWest Group later that year, taking the brand under which the
          majority of its business was delivered.[61][62] The change became effective on 22 July.[63]

          The bank operates "mobile branches" using converted vans to serve rural areas around St Austell, Swansea,
          Carlisle, Devon and North Wales.[74][75] The service allows to customers to carry out banking transactions in
          remote areas where there is no branch. NatWest reintroduced the mobile service in Cornwall in 2005, after HSBC
          ended its own version due to costs.[citation needed]

          In 2006, the then RBS Group undertook the first trial of PayPass contactless debit and credit cards in
          Europe.[76] In 2019, a NatWest pilot project was the first in the UK to trial debit cards containing
          fingerprint authentication technology developed by Dutch company, Gemalto.[77]

          The bank participates fully in the Faster Payments Service, an initiative to speed up certain payments,
          launched in 2008.[78] The bank established credit and debit card payment handling company Streamline in 1989,
          which was merged into Worldpay Group in 2009.[79] The NatWest Mobile Banking app is available to personal
          account holders over the age of 11 with online banking, a debit card and UK mobile telephone number (beginning
          07). The Emergency Cash service gives access to cash without a debit card from NatWest, RBS and Ulster Bank
          cash machines.[80]

          NatWest is a member of the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, Bankers' Automated Clearing Services, the
          Clearing House Automated Payment System and the LINK Interchange Network. The bank is authorised by the
          Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential
          Regulation Authority.[81] It is a member of the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Financial Services
          Compensation Scheme, UK Payments Administration and of the British Bankers' Association; and it subscribes to
          the Lending Code. Mortgages, available in England, Scotland and Wales only, are provided by National
          Westminster Home Loans, a member of the Council of Mortgage Lenders,[82]
